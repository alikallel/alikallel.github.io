                <h2 class="mb-4">My Academic Journey</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">My five-year program at INSAT is divided into two key phases. My journey began with the challenging 2-year Integrated Preparatory Cycle, followed by a three-year specialized Engineering Program.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-3">Preparatory Cycle: Building a Strong Foundation</h4>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    <p class="mb-3">The Preparatory Cycle is a hard two-year phase that lays the groundwork for engineering studies. Admission is highly competitive, based on academic records. The curriculum focuses on fundamental sciences and skills, including:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li class="mb-1"><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Analysis, Algebra, Probability, and Statistics</li>
                        <li class="mb-1"><strong>Physics:</strong> Geometric Optics, General Mechanics, Electrostatics, and Thermodynamics</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="mb-5">
                    <p>My MPI (Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science - first year) provided me with solid basics. After the first year, I chose Networks and Telecommunications (RT) as a specialization.</p>
                </div>

                <h4 class="mb-3">Engineering Cycle (3 Years): Diving into Specialization</h4>
                <div class="mb-5">
                    <p class="mb-3">The Engineering Cycle is a three-year phase that is equally transformative, during which I focus on advanced technical subjects across multiple domains. This comprehensive program trains engineers in computer science, telecommunications, and emerging technologies. Key courses include:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-4">
                        <li class="mb-1"><strong>Networking:</strong> IP Networks, Wireless Local Networks, Network architecture, and protocol design</li>
